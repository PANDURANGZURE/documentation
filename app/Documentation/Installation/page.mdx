    ## NPM (Package Manager)
    <Steps>
      ### Step 1: Create a React App
      Open your terminal and run the following command to create a new React app:
      ```bash
      npx create-react-app my-app
      ``` 
      ### Step 2: Navigate to Your Project Directory
      After creating your project, navigate to your project directory:
      ```bash
      cd my-app
      ``` 

      ### Step 3: Install the Package
      Run the following command in your project root to add the library as a dependency.
      ```bash
      npm install zure-ui
      ```

      ### Step 4: Start Building
      You can now import any component directly into your React files.
      ```jsx
      import { Button } from 'zure-ui';

      function App() {
        return <Button>Hello From Saurav Zure</Button>;
      }
      ```
    </Steps>
  

## MANUAL METHOD
  
    <Steps>
      ### Step 1: Create a Components Directory
      Ensure you have a dedicated folder for UI components (e.g., `src/components/ui`).

      ### Step 2: Create the Component Folder
      For each component you want to use, create a new folder named after the component.
      <FileTree>
        <FileTree.Folder name="src" defaultOpen>
          <FileTree.Folder name="components" defaultOpen>
            <FileTree.Folder name="Button" defaultOpen />
          </FileTree.Folder>
        </FileTree.Folder>
      </FileTree>

      ### Step 3: Add the Three Core Files
      Inside that new folder, create these three files and paste the code provided in the component's documentation:
      1.  `Button.jsx` (The Logic)
      2.  `button.module.css` (The Styles)
      3.  `index.js` (The Export)

      ### Step 4: Configure the Export
      Inside your `index.js`, ensure you have the following line so the component is easily accessible:
      ```javascript
      export { default as Button } from './Button';
      ```

      ### Step 5: Local Usage
      Import the component using your local path:
      ```jsx
      import { Button } from './components/Button';
      ```
    </Steps>

## Which method should I choose?

| Feature | NPM Method | Manual Method |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Updates** | `npm update` to get new features. | Manual copy-paste required. |
| **Customization** | Limited to props/theme variables. | **Full control** over every line of code. |
| **Bundle Size** | Only what you import (if tree-shaken). | Only the files you physically copy. |
| **Speed** | Fastest setup. | Takes 1-2 minutes per component. |
